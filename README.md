# BuPol examination preparation tool
Super simple (as yet) website for certain examination preparation. Started as a quick and simple tool for a friend to prepare
for the examination.

Can be found here: http://3.67.79.130:8888/

Will use this project to firm known tech stacks but also to learn and explore new things. Esp. when it comes to web based
frontends :) Some ideas which came to my mind:
* Getting proficient with Golang
* Implement a modern UI (Bootstrap or Vue.js) 
* HTTP session management (https://github.com/gorilla/sessions) and/or JWT based auth
* Some kind of CRUD "microservice" to handle progress of the user (SQL based DB, message broker like Rabbit or Kafka)
* Terraform for AWS resource management
